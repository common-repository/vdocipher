        <tr>
            <td>width</td>
            <td>Width of the video player. There will always be a <code>max-width: 100%</code> applied to the video player to avoid overflow. Hence, this is recommended to be set to the highest acceptable value. Do not append "px" at the end.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>height</td>
            <td>Recommended to be set to <code>auto</code>. Auto will mean that the height will be automatically adjusted according to the aspect ratio. If the height or width can not fit the available size, height will be adjusted using letter-boxing, meaning that black bars will be added in one-dimension until it fits.</td>
